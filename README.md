Hello guys, my full name is Van Ryan Nahine and im still a grade 11 ICT-CSS student.

I want to share my codes to all of my fellow students who are eager to learn programming.


This is my previous projects i made for fun... 

My school doesn't teach programming, so currently im a self learner for now and these codes i made doesn't really give me some extra grades at school.

so please give me some star to motivate me to code more⭐😁
